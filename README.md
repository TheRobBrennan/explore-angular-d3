# Welcome

The goal of this project is to explore working with [Angular](https://angular.io) and [D3](https://d3js.org) for data visualization.

## Examples

### Responsive bar graph

The `responsive-bar-graph` example was based on the [tutorial](https://medium.com/@jeanphilippelemieux/creating-a-responsive-graph-with-angular-and-d3-b45bb8065588) available at [Creating a responsive graph with Angular and D3](https://medium.com/@jeanphilippelemieux/creating-a-responsive-graph-with-angular-and-d3-b45bb8065588)
